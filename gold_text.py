When May set the March 29 exit date two years ago by serving the formal Article 50 divorce papers, she declared there would be "no turning back" but parliament's refusal to ratify the withdrawal deal she agreed with the EU has thrust her government into crisis. Now, just nine days before the exit date, May is to write to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for a short delay. May "won't be asking for a long extension, said a source in her Downing Street office, who spoke on condition of anonymity. May had warned lawmakers that she could seek an extension beyond June 30 if they voted down her treaty a third time. While the United Kingdom remains divided over Brexit, most agree that it will shape the prosperity of generations to come and, if it goes badly, could undermine the West and threaten London's position as the dominant global financial capital. The loss of Britain for the EU is the biggest blow yet to more than 60 years of effort to forge European unity in the wake of two world wars, though the 27 other members of the bloc have shown surprising unity during the tortuous negotiations. Britain's almost three-year crisis over Brexit has left allies and investors puzzled by a country that for decades seemed a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability."""]

"There"s no other way for us the achieve the savings for this car to be financially sustainable," he said. He declined to say how many reservations the company still had from customers who had expressed interest in buying a Model 3. Last summer, Tesla had more than 400,000 orders for the car. "The reservation list doesn"t matter," Mr. Musk said. Mr. Musk also expressed little certainty about how much demand the company is seeing for the Model 3. "My gut feel is 500,000 a year," he said. But he added: "I don"t know what demand is. We"ll see." To put buyers at ease about making such big-ticket purchases on the internet, he said, customers will be allowed to return cars for a full refund within seven days as long as the cars have not been driven more than 1,000 miles. "It"s going to be super easy to get a refund," he said. "People should not have concerns about placing an order." """]

I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me.” Responding to the accusation, Biden spokesman Bill Russo said the vice president had been happy to support Flores and to speak on her behalf at the event. “Neither then, nor in the years since, did he or the staff with him at the time have an inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor do they recall what she describes,” Russo said on Friday in a statement.
