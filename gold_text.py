gfirst = ["uk","""Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, British politicians are still arguing over how, when or even if the world's fifth largest economy should leave the bloc ---the United Kindom--- first joined 1973. When May set the March 29 exit date two years ago by serving the formal Article 50 divorce papers, ---May--- declared there would be "no turning back" but parliament's refusal to ratify the withdrawal deal ---May--- agreed with the EU has thrust ---May--- government into crisis. Now, just nine days before the exit date, May is to write to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for a short delay. May "won't be asking for a long extension, said a source in ---May--- Downing Street office, who spoke on condition of anonymity. May had warned lawmakers that ---May--- could seek an extension beyond June 30 if ---lawmakers--- voted down ---May--- treaty a third time. While the United Kingdom remains divided over Brexit, most agree that ---Brexit--- will shape the prosperity of generations to come and, if ---Brexit--- goes badly, could undermine the West and threaten London's position as the dominant global financial capital. The loss of Britain for the EU is the biggest blow yet to more than 60 years of effort to forge European unity in the wake of two world wars, though the 27 other members of the bloc have shown surprising unity during the tortuous negotiations. Britain's almost three-year crisis over Brexit has left allies and investors puzzled by a country that for decades seemed a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability."""]
